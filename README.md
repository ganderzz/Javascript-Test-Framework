## Running the Application

Everything is bundled together, so to start the Challenge Framework, just open index.html in any modern web browser.

## Development

All source files are located in *index.html* and the *scripts* and *styles* folders.

An already compiled version of the Challenge Framework is located in the *dist* folder. 
For any additional code changes, perform the following steps:

* Run `npm install` from the root of the project
* Edit code as needed
* Run `npm run minify` to concatenate all same type files into a single bundle in the *dist* folder

#### Unit Tests

Steps to run unit tests from the root of the project:

* Run `npm install`
* Start tests using `npm run tests`
